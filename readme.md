# Exam AZ-203: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure

This repository is meant to help you get certified in Microsoft Azure. It contains various resources and links to help you level up in developing applications for Microsoft Azure. Feel free to help out with new resources if you find any relevant ones.
The information in this repository is basedo on the skills measured in the exam.
You can read the details here on the Microsoft website: [Exam AZ-203: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-AZ-203.aspx)

## Getting Started
Azure can be quite intimidating because of the vast amount of services and options.
Therefore it would make sense to choose a specific learning path in order to learn how Azure can be used within the area you work in.
I would recommend everyone getting started with Azure to visit the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) portal. The portal is a great resource for getting familiar with services in Azure.
